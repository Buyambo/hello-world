# hello-world
My first repo

Welcome to my code! I am a very passionate UI/UX designer/developer who wears the hats of being a full-time father, an obsessive learner and so many others! 
This repo, for example, was written at about 01:40 in the morning while blasting hip-hop on max!
All in the pursuit of creating a better world for my kid's kid's kid; you feel me?
